Speech Recognition Project
This project utilizes the speech_recognition library to convert speech from audio files into text. It's designed to process .wav audio files, extracting the spoken content and exporting the transcribed text to an Excel file.

Prerequisites
Before you run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
pandas: pip install pandas
speech_recognition: pip install SpeechRecognition
PyAudio: pip install PyAudio (you might need this for speech_recognition to work properly)
Setup and Installation

Install the required libraries using:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Script
To run the script, you need to have .wav audio files in the same directory as your script.

Place your .wav audio files into the ./ directory (or modify the directory variable in the script to point to your audio files location).
Run the script using:
Copy code
python speech_to_text.py
Output
The script will create a DataFrame with the filenames and their corresponding transcribed text. If an audio file cannot be transcribed, an error message will be printed to the console.

An Excel file named output_voice_to_text.xlsx will be generated in the root directory, containing the results of the transcription.

Troubleshooting
If the audio cannot be recognized, ensure the .wav file is not corrupted and the speech is clear.
In case of any RequestError, check your internet connection or try increasing the timeout for the recognition service.
